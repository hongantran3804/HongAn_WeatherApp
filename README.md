I developed a weather app that allows users to input their location, 
including country, state (if in the US), and city. The app provides the current temperature, 
the highest and lowest temperatures at that time, as well as humidity and wind speed details. Additionally, users receive a forecast for the next 
five days, ensuring they have access to comprehensive and accurate weather information for their specific location.
